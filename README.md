## EduPlan

### Scenario
In the fast-paced academic environment, university students juggle multiple responsibilities, including assignments, discussions, club activities, and examinations. To effectively manage their time and prioritize their tasks, a well-structured To-Do List web application is required as an assistant to the students. This assignment requires you to develop a web application that is tailored to university students with the maximum number of web pages between 10–15 pages. Note that a pop-up dialog box is not considered a web page.

### Features
- **Task Recording**: Users can add tasks such as assignments, discussions, club activities, and examinations. Each task includes title, description, due date, and category.
- **Task Monitoring**: Users can view all tasks in a structured way with filtering options that allow sorting by category, priority, or due date.
- **Task Status Management**: Tasks can be marked as "On-going," "Pending," or "Completed."
- **Task Archiving**: Completed tasks are moved to an archive instead of being permanently deleted, and users can revisit archived tasks if necessary.
- **Task Prioritization**: Tasks can be assigned priority levels such as "High," "Medium," or "Low" to help students focus on urgent tasks first.
- **Reminder System**: Notifies students of approaching deadlines; users can set custom notifications based on their preferences.
